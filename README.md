# SEO-accessibility

## Summary of Changes
Wherever possible, I changed every div element to a semantic element to increase the readability of the HTML.  

Added id="search-engine-optimization" to allow same functionality as other 2 links.

I consolidated the selectors whenever possible to reduce repeated CSS code.

I organized CSS code sections to follow the same flow as the semantic HTML.

I added alt attributes under the image and icon elements.

I updated the website title to a short description of the page.

## Git 
I had issues with my SSH key when trying to commit the addition of the files in the local repo.

A Learning assistant set up another local repo in which i could work on the assigment changes, and at office hours on Monday, we resolved the issue.
